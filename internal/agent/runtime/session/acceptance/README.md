# Session Runtime acceptance tests

This package verifies the public Session Runtime contract in
`docs/design/session-runtime-requirements.md` against the current durable
`session_runs` schema.

The tests drive public HTTP and WebSocket APIs plus the authenticated Turn gRPC
process boundary used by a standalone Channel service. They do not construct a
`session.Manager`, handler, application service, sqlc query set, or database
adapter. A read-only SQL probe observes the deployment database after public
operations so the suite can verify facts that must survive process loss:

- one `session_id + invocation_id` maps to one `run_id` and `turn_id`;
- busy submissions leave no `session_runs` row and do not advance
  `bot_sessions.next_turn_position`;
- no session has more than one active ledger row;
- terminal history rows carry the admitted `run_id` and `turn_id`;
- pending decisions carry the same run and turn identities;
- owner or live-backend loss converges to a durable `lost` state.

Package-level algorithms remain covered by
`internal/agent/runtime/session/*_test.go`.

## Topologies

The suite has two isolated deployment shapes:

| Topology | Servers | Live backend | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `single` | 1 | memory | Default OSS boundary; Redis must not be required |
| `cluster` | 2 | Valkey | Cross-instance ownership, subscriptions, control and loss handling |

Both use real PostgreSQL 18 and a controllable OpenAI-compatible fake model.
The cluster topology uses a test-only TOML config and a non-persistent Valkey on
host port `16379`. Normal development and production configs are not modified.

Start one topology, run it, then stop it before switching:

```bash
mise run test:session-runtime:acceptance:env:single
mise run test:session-runtime:acceptance:single
mise run test:session-runtime:acceptance:env:down
```

```bash
mise run test:session-runtime:acceptance:env:cluster
mise run test:session-runtime:acceptance:cluster
mise run test:session-runtime:acceptance:cluster:destructive
mise run test:session-runtime:acceptance:env:down
```

The compatibility aliases `test:session-runtime:acceptance:env` and
`test:session-runtime:acceptance` select the cluster topology.

## Coverage

| Requirement | Black-box assertion |
| --- | --- |
| `SR-BASE-001` | `run_accepted`, ordered runtime output, completed ledger row, run-linked user and assistant history |
| `SR-ADM-001` | concurrent duplicate submissions return the same run/turn; fingerprint conflicts are stable and create no second row |
| `SR-OWN-001` | a second invocation receives `session_busy`, writes nothing, does not advance the turn counter, then succeeds after the active run ends |
| `SR-OBS-001` | reconnecting through the other Server receives a snapshot matching the durable run and turn |
| `SR-OBS-003` | two subscribers converge; closing the initiating socket does not stop the observer or run |
| `SR-CTL-001` | abort through the non-owner Server returns `control_ack`, cancels the model call and commits `aborted` |
| `SR-DUR-001` | after `SIGKILL`, input and identity remain in `session_runs` and the run becomes queryable as `lost` |
| `SR-DUR-002` | replaying a completed invocation does not call the model or add history rows |
| `SR-DEC-001` | live `ask_user` and tool approval decisions retain one run/turn/fence across WebSocket, HTTP and Turn gRPC; owner restart preserves and resumes the same decision |
| `SR-CTL-001` decision replay | a decision `control_id` returns the same acknowledgement after the run terminalizes; a stale new control resolves as `applied=false` without a retry code |
| PostgreSQL write budget | several owner-lease renewals leave `session_runs.updated_at`, owner, token and generation unchanged |
| backend loss | `FLUSHDB` preserves the grace interval and admission gate; old-generation runs become `lost` without replaying partial text; new-generation runs complete |

The fake model supports deterministic chunk count and pacing plus test-only
blocking and decision modes:

```text
[acceptance:marker chunks=20 delay_ms=50]
[acceptance:marker mode=block]
[acceptance:marker chunks=3 mode=partial_block]
[acceptance:marker mode=ask_user]
[acceptance:marker mode=tool_approval]
```

## Direct invocation

```bash
MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE=1 \
MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_REQUIRED=1 \
MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_MODE=cluster \
MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_BACKEND_LOSS=1 \
go test -tags=integration -count=1 -timeout=5m \
  ./internal/agent/runtime/session/acceptance
```

Useful environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_PRIMARY_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:18080` | Primary Server API |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_SECONDARY_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:18083` | Secondary Server API |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_PRIMARY_RPC_TARGET` | `127.0.0.1:19091` | Primary authenticated Turn gRPC endpoint |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_SECONDARY_RPC_TARGET` | `127.0.0.1:19092` | Secondary authenticated Turn gRPC endpoint |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_RPC_SECRET` | acceptance config value | Shared secret for the test-only Turn gRPC connection |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_POSTGRES_URL` | `postgres://memoh:…@127.0.0.1:15432/memoh` | Read-only acceptance probe target |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_REDIS_URL` | `redis://127.0.0.1:16379/0` | Isolated Valkey used by backend-loss injection |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_MODE` | `cluster` | `single` skips two-Server scenarios |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_CRASH` | unset | Enable destructive owner/decision restart cases |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_BACKEND_LOSS` | unset | Enable `FLUSHDB`; the cluster mise task sets it for isolated Valkey |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_PRIMARY_CONTAINER` | `memoh-dev-server` | Container killed by crash tests |
| `MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_FAKE_MODEL_PORT` | `19090` | Host port reachable by both Servers |

Crash and backend-loss cases are guarded because they intentionally kill a
container or erase the configured Redis database. The dedicated
`acceptance:cluster:destructive` task runs only the owner-restart contract and
sets the crash guard explicitly. Do not enable either fault against a shared
development or production environment.

## Execution and fault boundaries

These tests exercise the current public runtime, not the retired per-WebSocket
registry. A skipped or merely compiled suite is not acceptance evidence.

`TestQueueFollowUpsPreserveRepeatedReorderAndDrain` checks serial follow-up
admission after two reorder operations. `TestQueueSteerDecisionKeepsInputAndHistory`
checks a steer, an ask_user pause, another steer admitted while parked,
and persisted user inputs after the decision continuation.

`TestQueueSteerPreemptsModel` keeps the previous HTTP model request blocked until
test cleanup. Direct steer, follow-up promotion, silent sampling, consecutive
steers, provider retry, and stopping the continued run must preserve the run ID
and exactly one history input per submission. Each steer starts one successor
model call; the retry case also checks the original request's expected retry.
Cluster runs mutate through the
peer Server. Releasing the original request before asserting replacement would
test only eventual step-boundary consumption and is not a passing steer test.

`TestSRDUR002PreparedFinishSurvivesProcessCrash` is opt-in with
`MEMOH_SESSION_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_CRASH=1` and requires two Servers. Its temporary
PostgreSQL trigger gates only the generated invocation's terminal UPDATE after
the finishing proposal has committed. The real owner is killed, the gate is
released, and the peer must converge to the original outcome with unchanged
history and an available active slot. The trigger is removed and the owner
restarted in cleanup. This fault intentionally writes test-only database objects;
normal ledger probes remain read-only. Never run it against a shared database.
