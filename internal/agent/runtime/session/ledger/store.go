// transition. Nothing here is a
// keepalive or a progress sample, which is why write volume is proportional to
// the number of runs rather than to their duration or token rate. A reader
// therefore cannot ask this store "is the owner still alive"; only the live
// backend can answer that, and the reaper is built around that fact.
