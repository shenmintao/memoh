// ComposerDock — the orchestrator of everything that lives at the bottom of a
// chat pane. The dock is ONE component with TWO tiers of members, and every
// member — the composer included — is something this component arranges:
//
// - BOX tier (the input slot, exactly ONE occupant at a time): the composer
//   (default, injected via the slot) or the ask_user capsule. ask_user
//   REPLACING the composer is a deliberate product decision, not an accident:
//   while the agent is asking, answering is the only input that matters, and
//   the capsule's own free-text field IS the substitute input. That mutex is
//   a public capability of this dock: selecting an answer never releases it;
//   the capsule hands the slot back only when the request resolves or the user
//   explicitly cancels.
// - STACK tier (ComposerPanel, hugs the box): approvals / command results /
//   errors — surfaces the user answers with a CLICK, so they must not take
//   the input slot away.
//
// The composer is the ONE special member: it owns its radius/height morph and
// its focus machinery, so it is injected as slot content and this component
// only ADAPTS around it — measuring the slot box for the backdrop mask and
// hiding it (v-show, never unmount) while ask_user owns the slot. Everything
// else (approvals, command results, errors, ask_user) is an ordinary member:
// same capsule shell, no special-casing beyond what ComposerPanel does.
//
// The pane that hosts this dock stays the business owner: it injects the
// composer, feeds the queues as props, and answers events (command selection,
// dismissal, and focusing the textarea when the slot is handed back). All
// geometry/visibility orchestration lives HERE and nowhere else.
