-- 0147_context_lifecycle_selection_decisions
-- Move the per-fragment selection decisions out of the lifecycle snapshot into
-- their own column. The snapshot becomes a bounded summary, so list and status
-- readers never detoast the one part that grows with conversation length.
-- Existing rows are split in place, per team, because the table forces row
-- level security. Opening the teams policy takes an exclusive lock on
-- public.teams for the whole migration transaction while every lifecycle row is
-- rewritten twice, so run this with the server stopped, as the compose stack
-- does; on large tables expect it to take minutes.

ALTER TABLE public.context_lifecycles
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS selection_decisions JSONB;

-- The per-team loop reads public.teams, whose forced policy needs a bound
-- team; open it for the duration of this migration as 0120 does.
